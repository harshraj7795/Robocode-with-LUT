# Robocode-with-LUT
Implemented Reinforcement Learning using Look-up table on a robot tank to yield better performance with the number of progressing rounds of a robot tank battle on Robocode.
Compared the performances of Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms. Analyzed the convergence of win-rate and observed the effect of having intermediate rewards. Compared the performance 
with different exploration values.
